# makeRGB
If you are someone, who bought a Panono 360Â° Camera you might have the problem that their software to create RGB images out of the raw .upf files is no longer working - well here is the solution


- Copy (just one!) of the .upf files into a folder
- copy the python script makeRGB.py in the same folder and run it
- the code will convert the .upf file into 36 rgb images
- now you can stitch the 36 single images together using the open source software "microsoft Image Composite Editor"
